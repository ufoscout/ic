/// Public keys corresponding to the given node.
///
/// This struct is used for two purposes:
/// 1. As storage medium in the node's public key store. There, the `version`
///     field indicates if the I-DKG key is included, no matter if it was
///     generated together with all other keys (which is the case for new nodes)
///     or if it was generated separately afterwards (which is the case for
///     existing nodes): Version 0 means the key is *not* included. Version 1
///     means the key is included.
/// 2. As input parameter for node key validation performed by the
///     `ic-crypto-node-key-validation` crate. There, the version field indicates
///     whether the key validation shall include the I-DKG key: Version 0 means
///     the validation shall *not* include the I-DKG key. Version 1 means the
///     key validation shall include the I-DKG key.
